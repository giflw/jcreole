This directory branch serves as a runtime-usage public repository for the
google-code-prettify Javascript library.
For brevity, I'll call the product just "prettify" hereafter.
This is provided as a convenience for application developers so they don't
need to bundle prettify resources with their applications.
It would be great if the prettify team would provide such a repository
themselves, but they don't.

The subdirectories were created by just exploding the "small" public release
distributions of prettify (after fixing the bad file permissions in those
distributions), which are available directly from
http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/downloads/list

The subdirectories here are named precisely according to prettify distribution
versions.
