<<masterDefList>>

<<masterDefEntry Scott, Michael>>Office manager.
Notice that even though I have written this entry first and I have referenced
it first, it will not be first
in the list of entries because the list gets sorted by the definienda.

Saleswoman.<<masterDefEntry Vance, Phylis>>  Feisty.  This entry is not referenced from the
main document body.

For contrast, regular explicit links to local, relative URLs, both
[[labeled.txt|Labelled]] and [[unlabeled.txt]].

Main body text paragraph here, with the [[Scott, Michael]] auto-labelled link,
and a second [[Beasley, Pam|explicitly labelled link]].
And to show that multiple references to a shared entry work, here's a
[[Scott, Michael|second link to the Scott entry]].

<<masterDefEntry Beasley, Pam>>Saleswoman.  Previously the office receptionist.
