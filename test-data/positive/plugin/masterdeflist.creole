=====Sample Master Definition List Section
You can insert the Definition List wherever you want to in your document.
<<masterDefList>>

<<masterDefEntry Scott, Michael>>Office manager.
Notice that even though I have written this entry first and I have referenced
it first, it will not be first
in the list of entries because the list gets sorted by the definienda.

Main body text paragraph here, with the [[Scott, Michael]] auto-labelled link,
and a second [[Beasley, Pam|explicitly labelled link]].
And to show that multiple references to a shared entry work, here's a
[[Scott, Michael|second link to the Scott entry]].

<<masterDefEntry Beasley, Pam>>Saleswoman.  Previously the office receptionist.
