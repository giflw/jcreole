<p>Main body text pagraph here, with the first reference<a class="jcreole_fnref" href="#jcfn2"><sup>1</sup></a>
and a second reference<a class="jcreole_fnref" href="#jcfn1"><sup>2</sup></a>.
And to show that multiple references to a shared entry work, here's a second
ref to the first entry<a class="jcreole_fnref" href="#jcfn2"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<h5 id="jcsect_SampleFootnotesDocumentSection"><span class="jcreole_hbody">Sample Footnotes Document Section</span></h5>
<p>Note that though you will usually want to insert the footnote entry listing at
the end of your document, it's awful useful for special cases like this one, to
be able to place it wherever you want to.</p>
<div class="jcx_footnotes">

  <dt>1</td>
  <dd><p id="jcfn2">First sample entry.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>2</td>
  <dd><p id="jcfn1">Second sample entry.
Notice that even though I have written this entry first, it will be second in
the list of entries because it is <em>referenced</em> second.</p>
