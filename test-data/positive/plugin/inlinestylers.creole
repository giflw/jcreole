This paragraph tests a before (-) Styler.
**Bold will not be modified.**
//Italic will be.//
<<-(pre1>>
**Bold and //Nested italic// Closing both.**
Done closed.

In 2nd paragraph, inside another //Italic and a <<{>>JCX span, will
<<-(pre2>>style the last CLOSED (bold) span<<}>> from previous paragaph.

Inside the third paragraph I once again nest //Italic and then
**bold, closing neither but styling the bold <<=(cont>> current container.
Also here directing to style the bold in a paragraph down 2, twice with
post1 <<+(post1>> and <<+(post2>>post2.

Do-nothing paragraph, just to intercede.

Finally our ** bold and // italic paragraph.
