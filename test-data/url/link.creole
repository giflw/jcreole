Plain links.  First escaped bare URLs http:~//cnn.com/x.html
and ftp:~//pub.admc.com.\\
Now live bare URLs with trailing punctuation that should not be linked:
http://cnn.com/x.html? and ftp://pub.admc.com.
And then [[rela~ tive.html]] link and [[rel.html|labelled \\ ~ rel link]]
(notice that markup not formatted in link or URL).
Finally [[http://abso~ lute./x.html]] link and [[ftp://abso/~blaine|labelled \\ ~ abs. link]].

~http://cnn\\.com and ~http://cnn.com/x/y.ht\\ml are escaped, preventing recognition as bare URL for linking, but unlike above, the entire URL will be escaped.

w/ Image.
[[rel.html|{{rela~ tive.jpg}}]]
 [[ftp://abso/~blaine|{{ftp://abso/~blaine|alted \\ ~ abs. image}}]].

And then there are [[wiki~ :li:nk|labelled]] and unlabelled [[wiki:li:nk]]s.

Stupidly should recognize URLS insidehttp:~//admc.com words.
http://admc.com should always work as first item on line too.
