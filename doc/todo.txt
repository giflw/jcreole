SHORT TERM

Implement Index:
    <<(indexEntry [entry]>>some content<<)>>  Links target from index.
    If author codes a <<{...>> but has no <<index>>
     then complain about orphaned index entries.
     ... But what if framing page wants to fetch and display index?

Implement Glossary:
    Directives in the main body are authored exactly line indexEntries, except
    <<(glossaryEntry [entry]>>some content<<)>>  Links target from glossary
                             (and either links TO glossary or Pops-up)
    It is a runtime error if there is no <<glossaryEntry>> paragraph for it.
    If author codes a <<{...>> but has no <<glossary>>
     then complain about orphaned index entries.
     ... But what if framing page wants to fetch and display glossary?

Consider how to allow author to specify link target, or at least whether to
open in-page or out-of-page.

Consider how to allow author to hyperlink a broader set of content than just a
non-markup label.

LONG TERM

Branch Beaver and do some major re-design.
    Write Terminals as a real enum.
    Fix the anti-OO way that beaver.Symbol must be overridden.
    Change label-variable behavior to be consistent.  Don't have the semantics
     and type of the generated variable entirely dependent upon something else.
     Generated variable "x" for "expr.x" should always be the same damned thing.
    Use more rigorous type-checking for ArrayList usage.
    Fix bugs where . operating behavior differs from + in unintended and bad
     ways.
    Use Generics.
