LONG TERM

Branch Beaver and do some major re-design.
    Write Terminals as a real enum.
    Fix the anti-OO way that beaver.Symbol must be overridden.
    Change label-variable behavior to be consistent.  Don't have the semantics
     and type of the generated variable entirely dependent upon something else.
     Generated variable "x" for "expr.x" should always be the same damned thing.
    Use more rigorous type-checking for ArrayList usage.
    Fix bugs where . operating behavior differs from + in unintended and bad
     ways.
    Use Generics.
