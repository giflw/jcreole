SHORT TERM

Get single-row tables working.  Try by just changing .+ to .*.  If yes, then
use this same tactic at other place use the duplication work-around.  If no,
then get copying code.

Use a dependset or something in build file to ensure that jflex really executes
if beaver executes.

Rename ivy.xml to template-ivy.xml, .gitexclude that file, and generate
ivy.xml from the template in the same way as the jul cfg file is generated by
build.xml in the plugins branch.

Consider how to allow author to specify link target, or at least whether to
open in-page or out-of-page.

Implement and publish a trivial sandbox webapp.

LONG TERM

Branch Beaver and do some major re-design.
    Write Terminals as a real enum.
    Fix the anti-OO way that beaver.Symbol must be overridden.
    Change label-variable behavior to be consistent.  Don't have the semantics
     and type of the generated variable entirely dependent upon something else.
     Generated variable "x" for "expr.x" should always be the same damned thing.
    Use more rigorous type-checking for ArrayList usage.
    Fix bugs where . operating behavior differs from + in unintended and bad
     ways.
    Use Generics.
