SHORT TERM

Implement jcxBlock

Implement section-counting.
    Rigorous testing of nesting and sequencing.
    Implement sequenceLabeling.
    Implement <<toc>> Plugin.
    Defer all default link label generation to a new first post-processing pass.
        If URL begins with #, look up the URL in hIdMap and set the label.

Make every extension instance-togglable.  Either throw or silently ignore
extension X if extension X is not enabled.

Implement features listed in "additions.txt".

Consider how to allow author to specify link target, or at least whether to
open in-page or out-of-page.

Consider how to allow author to hyperlink a broader set of content than just a
non-markup label.

Implement and publish a trivial sandbox webapp.

LONG TERM

Branch Beaver and do some major re-design.
    Write Terminals as a real enum.
    Fix the anti-OO way that beaver.Symbol must be overridden.
    Change label-variable behavior to be consistent.  Don't have the semantics
     and type of the generated variable entirely dependent upon something else.
     Generated variable "x" for "expr.x" should always be the same damned thing.
    Use more rigorous type-checking for ArrayList usage.
    Fix bugs where . operating behavior differs from + in unintended and bad
     ways.
    Use Generics.
