This document describes JCreole's "additions" to the Creole 1.0 feature set,
excluding those features controlled by plugin directives <<X>>.
For compatibility purposes, features in JCreole are normally impemented as
plugins.  But some features require no page-author involvement, and others are
already documented as optional Creole 1.0 "additions".  These features are
documented here.
(Some overlap is unavoidable.  To avoid duplicating my efforts, my tactic is to
document each feature in "additions.txt" or "extensions.txt" based on whether
or not plugins are central or critical to the feature's usage.)

Creole 1.0 optional Additions are documented at
http://wiki.wikicreole.org/Creole%201.0/additions and a couple under "Will
Discuss..." at http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Elements .
The individual features implemented are listed below.
I am considering documenting why I have chosen not to implement some
Creole-suggested additions that I do not like.

Auto-Id & Auto-link-labels

    Unique HTML element id's are generated for all heading elements.
    This allows for intra-document or inter-document links to link directly to
    any heading in this document.
    Implementation of this feature involves just generation of legal XML id
    attributes, and needs no page author involvement whatsoever.
    If a page author wants to link to headings, just use the generated id's
    in hrefs (the names begin with "jcsect_" and are easy to infer).
    These id's are leveraged by the section-counting and TOC plugin features,
    which are described in the extensions.txt file (because there are plugin
    directives to customize both of these sub-features).

    If the page author adds a link to an auto-generated header id, but supplies
    no "label", instead of labeling with the "#idtext", we generate a label from
    the target header's content.  For example:
        [[#jcsect_WashingClothesInTheWild]]
    will generate something like
        <a href="#jsect_WashingClothesInTheWild">Washing Clothes in the Wild</a>
