Compatibility-effecting Changes

For version 1.2.0 escaping rules were made more general.
See the Reference guide for full rules.  Abbreviated rules are:
    ~ escapes the following character, with exceptions
        {{{...}}} bodies (including closing "}}}") may not be escaped
        <<...>> bodies (including closing ">>") may not be escaped
        http[s] URLs are not treated as URLs if immediately proced with ~
    {{{...}}} only cause pre-formatting if both the "{{{" and the "}}}" are only thing on their respective lines.  Otherwise it causes just regular character escaping.
    <<prettyPrint...> is not allowed inside of paragraphs.
    <<prettyPrint...> is allowed inside of lists.
    $[x] vars escaped with \ or ~. ${x} vars escaped with \.

For version 1.2.0 variable usage was generalized and improved.
    $(x) variable substitution is done above the JCreole layer (Servlet or Java main layer, for example).
    $[x] variables are de-referenced early and are substituted into Creole.
    ${x} variables are de-referenced late and are substituted into HTML.

Some API changes to JCreole methods to accommodate variable usage changes (see previous item).

For version 1.3.0
    Directive "enumFormat" was changed to "sectionEnumSymbols"
    Directive "enumFormatReset" was changed to "sectionEnumReset"
"sectionEnumSymbols" and "sectionEnumReset" are still honored but deprecated, and documents will use only the new names.
